# CactusShader
A minecraft shader made from scratch by Kyriefos.

Shadows, waving plants, clouds, waving water etc. this shader has it all!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The shaderpack is currently in early development, so there are bugs. examples are:
- waving glass, because of the water shader
- pitch black end dimension

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

New features will be added in the future.
